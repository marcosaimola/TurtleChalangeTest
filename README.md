# TurtleChalangeTest
This code was written using C# .Net Core as a part of a job application in a company that I really like to work for.

## The solution has three projects:  
- **Test** - Where tests were written to validate the result of actions
- **Library** - Where are the classed template and business rules for the game
- **View** - console application where game outputs are displayed
